        "Except Fantasia, default parameter values here can mostly work fine, but here they can be customized as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Username Column Name`: This is the column name of the username field in the Staff Spreadsheet. This is by default `ToF Username` for Phantasia and Sacred Sakura, but `ToF Username - {number of members}`. For Fantasia, this column name needs to be set here.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Output File Name`: This is the filename of the output csv file, by default set to `CrewDonationStats.csv`. Can leave this as is, or change to anything else that you wish. Just be sure to have the `.csv` extension at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Score Cutoff`: The Fuzzy String matching program code here computes a similarity score between 0 and 100. Two exactly same names will have a score of 100. Here we set a score cutoff for finding matches between names in the Crew sheet and the Staff sheet. The default is 70, but this can be increased or decreased if you want to experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Mode`: There are two modes. `staff-to-crew` mode matches staff spreadsheet names to crew screenshot names. This is the default, and should be used to fill up weekly donation info. Blank entries here will mean that the name in spreadsheet wasn't found in crew screenshot. This could be due to very short name, incorrect OCR reading from crew screenshot, or someone in crew changing their username which wasn't tracked in staff spreadsheet. For the case that sometimes players change their username, there exists the `crew-to-staff` mode, which matches crew screenshot names to staff spreadsheet names. Blank spaces should help to find names in spreadsheet which don't exist in crew screenshot. (Of course, it could be that short names or incorrect OCR reading messed up, but this simplifies finding out who changed their name).\n",
